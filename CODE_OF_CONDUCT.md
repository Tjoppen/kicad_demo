Long ago in a distant land
I Aku the shapeshifting master of darkness
unleashed an unspeakable evil!
But a FOOLISH samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword
stepped forth to OPPOSE me.
Before the final blow was struck
I tore open a portal in time
and flung him into the future
where my evil is LAW!
Now the fool seeks to return to the past
and undo the future that is AKU!
